                    Choose a public place for the first meeting, such as a bar, cinema, or museum.
                    Inform someone of the meeting place and time, and if needed, bring a friend along.
                    Do not give out personal information before you know the person you are contacting through our website.
                    Do not provide your bank statements to anyone.
                    Be wary of people asking for financial "help"; never accept. In case of fraud, we decline any liability.
